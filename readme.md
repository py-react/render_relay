  ✨ 🚀 Full-Stack Development Experience with Python and React ✨ 🚀 <br/>
</h2>

Unlike typical setups where Node.js serves as the backend for frontend applications, this project leverages Python to deliver a comprehensive full-stack solution.

`Note: The GingerJs meta-framework is currently under development. As such, features and specifications are subject to change as we refine and enhance the framework`

### Install GingerJS

#### Python Environment and Requirements
Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies locally:
```shell
virtualenv env
```
Activate the virtual environment:
```shell
source env/bin/activate
```
Alternatively:

```shell
. env/bin/activate
```


Now, you need to install GingerJS using `pip`. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:


```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/ginger-society/ginger-js.git
```

### Create your app

```bash
render_relay create-app
```

### Run server

```bash
render_relay runserver
```


The application will run on port 5001 by default.
If 5001 is already in use, You can change the default port by adding port in `settings.py`
```python
PORT=3000
```

## Main Features
Some of the main py-react features include:

Feature | Description
--- | --- 
Routing | A file-system based router built on top of FastAPI and Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, and more. 
Rendering | Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with py-react.
Styling | Support for your preferred styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge
Although our docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the docs can stay focused on py-react functionality. We'll make sure to provide links to relevant documentation whenever we introduce a new concept.

To get the most out of our docs, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of FastAPI,HTML, CSS, and React. If you need to brush up on your React skills, check out this [React Foundations Course](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), which will introduce you to the fundamentals.


## Creating your First Page

### Layouts
A layout is UI that is shared between multiple routes. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive. Layouts can also be nested.

You can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a layout.jsx file. The component will be populated with a child layout (if it exists) or a page during rendering.
```jsx
import React from "react";
import Header from "../components/header";
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

const Layout = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Layout;

```

For example, the layout will be shared with the /dashboard and /dashboard/settings pages:
![NextJs layout example image](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fnested-layout.png&w=3840&q=75)

If you were to combine the two layouts above, the root layout (app/layout.jsx) would wrap the dashboard layout (app/dashboard/layout.jsx), which would wrap route segments inside app/dashboard/*.

The two layouts would be nested as such:
![NextJs Multi layout example image](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fnested-layouts-ui.png&w=3840&q=75)

## Linking and Navigating
There are currently two ways to navigate between routes in gingerJs:

- Using the Link Component (currently exported from libs)
- Using the useNavigate hook (currently exported from libs)

This page will go through how to use each of these options, and dive deeper into how navigation works.

## Dynamic Routes
When you don't know the exact segment names ahead of time and want to create routes from dynamic data, you can use Dynamic Segments that are filled in at request time.

### Convention
A Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a folder's name in square brackets: [folderName]. For example, [id] or [slug].

You can use useParam hook to get the values in component/pages
For ecample if your folder structure looks like `src/app/products/[productId]/index.jsx`
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function Product() {
  const { productId } = useParams();
  return (
    <>
      {productId}
    </>
  );
}

export default Product;

```
Alternatively:
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function Product({productId}) {
  return (
    <>
      {productId}
    </>
  );
}

export default Product;

```

## Server-Side Props

In a Python environment, you can fetch data, interact with the database, and pass the data to your page.

### Convention

The server logic is placed alongside `index.jsx` and `layout.jsx` within the same folder and is named `index.py`.

### Example
#### Server Example
Path Example : `src/app/index.py`
```python
from fastapi import Request
import requests

def index(request:Request):
    api_url = f'https://dummyjson.com/products/'  # Replace this with the URL of the API you want to fetch data from
    # ----or---
    # productId = request.args.get("productId")
    # api_url = f'https://dummyjson.com/products/
    
    response = requests.get(api_url)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        return {"products":{data}}
    return {"products":{"data": None,"error":{"message":"Something went wrong! Please try again"}}}

```

#### Component Example
Path Example : src/app/products/[productId]/index.jsx
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function Products({products}) {
  return (
    <>
      {JSON.stringify(products,null,4)}
    </>
  );
}

export default Products;
```

#### layout server Example
If you want to pass props to layout you just have to define a layout in your `index.py`

Path Example : `src/app/index.py`
```python
from fastapi import Request

def layout(request:Request):
    return {"serverData":"some_data"}
```


#### layout client Example
Path Example : src/app/layout.jsx (will be visible to all subroute)
```jsx
function Layout({serverData}) {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="p-0 m-0">
        <Header data={serverData}/>
        <Outlet />
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default Layout;
```

#### Middleware Example

Or you want attach a middleware, Just define a middleware in `index.py`

Path Example : `src/app/index.py`
```python
from fastapi import Request

async def middleware(request:Request,call_next):
    token = request.headers.get('X-Auth-Token')
    if token != 'secret-token':
      # raise 403
    return call_next(request)

```

#### Api and middleware example 
Path Example : `src/app/api/product/index.py`
```python
from fastapi import Request

def GET(request:Request):
    data = {}
    for key,value in request.args.items():
        data[key] = value
    return {"query":data}
  

async def middleware(request:Request,call_next):
    token = request.headers.get('X-Auth-Token')
    if token != 'secret-token':
      # raise 403
    return call_next(request)

```

Enjoy your full-stack development experience with Python and React!

#### Using styled-components
Inside your root `layout.jsx` define getAppContext function

```jsx
import { ServerStyleSheet } from 'styled-components';

async getAppContext = (ctx)=>{
  const sheet = new ServerStyleSheet();
  ctx.renderApp:()=>({
    enhanceApp:(App)=>App,
    getStyles:(App)=>sheet.collectStyles(App),
    styles:()=>sheet.getStyleTags(),
    finally:()=>{
      sheet.seal()
    }
  })
  return ctx
}

```


#### Using Theme
Inside your root `layout.jsx`

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";
import { ThemeProvider } from "src/libs/theme-provider"

function Layout(props) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="light" enableSystem>
        <div className="p-0 m-0 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white">
          {/* Layout component */}
          <Outlet />
        </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

Add Meta Data 
```python
# add the below in your index.py file
def meta_data():
    return {
        "title": "Ginger-Js",
        "description": "Some Description",
        "og:description": "Description Here",
        "icon":"/static/images/favicon.ico"
    }
```

Overide config 
```js
// create a "ginger_conf.cjs" at root of the project and add the below in the file

module.exports = {
    webpack:{}
}
```

Extend main app
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI,Request
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
from starlette.requests import Request
from datetime import datetime
import time


class RequestLoggerMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        # Record the start time
        start_time = time.time()
        
        # Log request method and URL
        
        # Process the request and get the response
        response = await call_next(request)
        
        # Record the end time
        end_time = time.time()
        
        # Calculate the time taken for the request
        duration = round(end_time - start_time, 4)  # Duration in seconds, rounded to 4 decimal places
        
        # Log the response status code and time taken
        print(f"Time taken: {duration} seconds | [{request.method}] {request.url.path} | Response status code: {response.status_code} ")
        
        return response

# Function to extend the app by adding routes
def extend_app(app: FastAPI):
    # Add the custom RequestLoggerMiddleware
    app.add_middleware(RequestLoggerMiddleware)

```

### Using FastAPI with Type Safety

Below snippets demonstrates how to use the FastAPI client with type safety for improved developer experience and better integration.

#### Step 1: Import the Service
Begin by importing the service module into your project
```js
import { DefaultService } from "@/gingerJs_api_client";
```
This will allow you to interact with the API endpoints defined in the FastAPI server.

#### Step 2: Call the Service
You can now call the service method using type-safe functions. For example, to make an API request to the apiTestGet endpoint:

```js
await DefaultService.apiTestGet()
```
By leveraging the type safety features, you get better auto-completion, error handling, and validation during development.
